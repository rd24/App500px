Gridview is used to display Images from the API.

To make network call, I have used Volley library.

To load images from the url, Picasso library is used.

Toolbar is used to display app name in the main page and to display Image name in the Image detail page.

User can view full size of Image, Image name, camera that is used to click image, image description,ratings and the person who clicked the image in Image Detail page.

The detail is displayed in PhotoDetailFragment.

Adjustviewbound property is used to maintain aspect ratio of the image in the grid list item layout.

Entity package contains all the data model object that is returned from the API.
